Welcome. 
I'm a Research Director in computer vision at Inria Paris, where I lead the [Astra-Vision group](https://astra-vision.github.io/), within the [ASTRA team](https://astra-team.github.io/). 
My Habilitation (HDR) was completed in 2022, and my PhD in 2012 from Mines Paris. I worked in Carnegie Mellon Uni. (2011), Mines Paris (2013), and Uni. of Makedonia (2014). Beside research, I serve in most venues of the field as area chair (CVPR, ECCV, WACV, IROS), co-organize events such as ACVSS, WSCV, Indaba, and am currently an ELLIS member and a PR\[AI\]RIE-PSAI Fellow.

My research interest lies in robust and interpretable visual scene understanding.
